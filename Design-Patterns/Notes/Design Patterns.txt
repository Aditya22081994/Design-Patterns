Creational  Patterns :::::
Singleton Pattern : 
-> This pattern is used to restrict the multiple instantiations of an object(i.e only a single instance of the class is allowed).
-> Some objects are needed to instantiate only once(for example the preference object in a game)(having multiple preference objects can cause issues in the system).
-> This is achieved by providing a private constructor(which restricts other classes to instantiate the singleton class using "new" operator)
-> The client classes can get the instantiated object through a public method declared in the singleton class.

Factory Pattern : 
-> This pattern is used to create a factory class which is responsible to instantiate the objects of classes.
-> By using this pattern the client classes are restricted to directly instantiate the objects of the classes and this responsibility is outsourced to the factory class.
-> The client classes can get the instances of the object through this factory class object.

Factory Method Pattern :
-> This pattern is same as factory pattern except that the responsibility of instantiating the objects of classes is outsourced to a method instead of a seperate class.


Structural Patterns :::::
Facade Pattern : 
-> This pattern is used to provide a simple interface(not a Java Interface) to a complex sub system.
-> The facade class is used to provide simple endpoints for accessing our sub system.
-> The facade class uses the existing sub system classes and does not introduce any new functionalities into the system.
-> The client classes can access the sub system through the facade class which is not difficult to deal with.
